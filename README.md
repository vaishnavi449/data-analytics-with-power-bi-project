Global Malnutrition Trends: A Power BI Analysis (1983-2019)

Malnutrition remains a critical global health issue, with children in lower-income countries disproportionately affected

Project Description

Introduction:

ABC Company is undertaking an in-depth analysis of global malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019 to better understand the prevalence and distribution of various forms of malnutrition among children under five years of age. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from UNICEF/WHO/World Bank, the project aims to analyze severe wasting, wasting, stunting, underweight, and overweight conditions across different countries. By classifying countries according to their income levels (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income) and other categories such as Least Developed Countries (LDC), Low Income Food Deficient (LIFD), Land Locked Developing Countries (LLDC), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the project seeks to uncover correlations between economic status and malnutrition rates. Through the use of advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI, including stacked bar charts and line charts, ABC Company aims to generate actionable insights that can guide policy-making and resource allocation to combat child malnutrition effectively.

Malnutrition remains a critical global health issue, with children in lower-income countries disproportionately affected. ABC Company aims to address the challenge of identifying key patterns and trends in child malnutrition data over several decades. The primary problem is to determine how various forms of malnutrition correlate with economic and geographical classifications of countries, and to identify which countries and regions are most affected. By leveraging historical data, the project will highlight areas needing urgent attention and support, helping stakeholders to prioritize interventions and strategies for reducing malnutrition and its associated health risks among children under five. This analysis is crucial for developing targeted, data-driven solutions to improve child health outcomes worldwide.
