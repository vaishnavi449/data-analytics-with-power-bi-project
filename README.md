Global Malnutrition Trends: A Power BI Analysis (1983-2019)

Malnutrition remains a critical global health issue, with children in lower-income countries disproportionately affected

Project Description

Introduction:

ABC Company is conducting a comprehensive analysis of global malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019, focusing on its impact on children under five. Using datasets from UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank, the study examines various forms of malnutrition, including severe wasting, wasting, stunting, underweight, and overweight conditions across different countries. The research classifies nations based on economic status (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income) and other categories such as Least Developed Countries (LDC), Low-Income Food Deficient (LIFD) nations, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDC), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to identify correlations between economic conditions and malnutrition rates.

Malnutrition remains a critical global health challenge, with children in lower-income regions facing the highest risk. By analyzing historical data and exploring the link between malnutrition, economic classification, and geography, ABC Company aims to uncover key patterns and trends. Utilizing advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI, including stacked bar charts and line charts, the study transforms complex data into actionable insights. These findings will help policymakers, health organizations, and stakeholders make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted interventions to reduce child malnutrition and improve global health outcomes.
